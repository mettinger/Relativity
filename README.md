# Relativity in Lean

This is a formalization of special relativity in the Lean language.  It is based on the paper "A Logic Road From Special Relativity to General Relativity" (Andreka, Madarasz, Nemeti, Szekely), available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1005.0960 and "Logic of Space-Time and Relativity Theory" (Andreka, Madarasz, Nemeti) in _Handbook of Spatial Logics_, (Aiello, Pratt-Hartmann, van Bentham editors).
